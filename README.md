# Web3-Blockchain-ICP

This repository contains all my Web3 projects from the [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp) "The Complete Web Development Bootcamp".

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find a collection of projects focusing on Web3 development and blockchain integration. These projects cover various aspects of decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain technologies, built using React, JavaScript, and Motoko, specifically for the ICP (Internet Computer Protocol) blockchain. Some of the projects included are:

- **DBank**: A decentralized banking application utilizing blockchain technology.
- **dkeeper**: An application for managing digital assets securely on the blockchain.
- **hello**: Initial commit, possibly a starter project or exploration.
- **opend**: A finished project, potentially a NFT marketplace.
- **token**: A project related to creating and managing custom crypto tokens.

## Running the App

To run the apps, follow these steps:

1. Install all necessary Node packages by running the following command in your terminal:
`npm install`

2. Start the DFX (Internet Computer Software Development Kit) canister by running:
`dfx start`

3. Deploy the canister using the following command:
`dfx deploy`

4. Finally, host the canister locally on localhost by running:
`npm start`

Once these steps are completed, you should be able to access the application



## Certificate

Upon completion of the Udemy course, a certificate was issued. You can view the certificate [here](https://github.com/FelixMairamhof/WebDevCourse/files/15177071/WebDevCourse.pdf)

Explore these projects to delve into Web3 development and learn about integrating blockchain technology into web applications.
